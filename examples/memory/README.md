# MultiMind Memory Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating the usage of various memory types in the MultiMind SDK.

## Examples

### Basic Memory Usage (`basic_usage.py`)
Demonstrates basic memory operations using the HybridMemory system:
- Creating a memory system with multiple memory types
- Adding and retrieving memories
- Updating memories
- Getting memory statistics

### Quantum Memory Usage (`quantum_memory.py`)
Shows how to use quantum memory types:
- QRAM (Quantum Random-Access Memory)
- QAM (Quantum Associative Memory)
- Topological Memory
- Quantum-Classical Hybrid Memory

### LLM Integration (`llm_integration.py`)
Demonstrates integration with Language Models:
- Using memory systems with LLMs
- Processing conversations with memory context
- Quantum-enhanced LLM responses
- Hybrid memory for LLM context

### Advanced Memory Manager (`advanced_memory_manager.py`)
Implements enterprise-grade memory management features:
- Retention policies and eviction strategies
- Merge and conflict resolution
- Debug and trace tooling
- Privacy and access controls
- User profile management
- Event hooks for reactive workflows
- Audit logging and monitoring

### Multi-modal Memory Manager (`multimodal_memory.py`)
Supports various content types and modalities:
- Text, image, audio, and video content
- Code and structured data
- Content-specific processing
- Cross-modal search and retrieval
- Embedding generation for different content types

## Running the Examples

To run any example:

```bash
python basic_usage.py
python quantum_memory.py
python llm_integration.py
python advanced_memory_manager.py
python multimodal_memory.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- MultiMind SDK
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Asyncio
- Additional dependencies for multi-modal support:
  - Pillow (for image processing)
  - librosa (for audio processing)
  - opencv-python (for video processing)
  - transformers (for text embeddings)

## Notes

- The examples use async/await for memory operations
- Quantum memory examples require quantum computing resources
- LLM integration examples require API keys for the language model
- Memory statistics and performance may vary based on system resources
- Advanced features require appropriate system permissions and resources

## Best Practices

1. Always use async/await for memory operations
2. Implement error handling for quantum operations
3. Monitor memory statistics for optimization
4. Use appropriate memory types for different use cases
5. Consider hybrid approaches for complex scenarios
6. Implement proper access controls and security measures
7. Use retention policies to manage memory lifecycle
8. Monitor and log memory operations for debugging
9. Implement proper conflict resolution strategies
10. Use event hooks for reactive system design
